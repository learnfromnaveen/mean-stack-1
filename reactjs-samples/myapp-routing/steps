Steps to set up routing

1. install package react-router-dom

   npm install react-router-dom


2. Import the following as given below  

   import  { 
       BrowserRouter as Router, 
       Switch, 
       Route, 
       Link, 
       NavLink
   }
   from  'react-router-dom';

3.  Wrap the JSX expression with Router ( BrowserRouter )

     <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Users</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/users">Users</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        {/* A <Switch> looks through its children <Route>s and
            renders the first one that matches the current URL. */}
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/user">
            <User/>
          </Route>
          <Route path="/users">
            <Users />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/">
            <Users />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
